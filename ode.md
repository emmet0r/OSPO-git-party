**An Ode to Learning Git & GitHub**  

Amid the halls of UCSC's domain,  
Three colleagues sought to master the terrain.  
In their OSPO's realm, they ventured forth,  
With Git and GitHub, they aimed for worth.  

With each commit, they learned and grew,  
Through merges, conflicts, they persevered anew.  
For in this journey, they found the key,  
To unlock the power of collaboratsaation's decree.  

Through pull requests and branches bold,  
Their knowledge soared, their stories TOLD.  
Encouraged by the community's embrace,  
  
They navigated with skill and grace.
